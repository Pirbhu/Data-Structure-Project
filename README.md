# Grammar Checking System using Data Structures

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **menu-driven Grammar Checking System** developed using **Data Structures concepts**.  
The program checks whether an input sentence is **grammatically correct** based on predefined grammar rules and parts of speech.

Due to limited data (nouns, pronouns, verbs, etc.), the system may fail in some cases. However, the project successfully demonstrates how **data structures and file handling** can be used to build a functional grammar-checking application.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To apply core **Data Structures concepts** in a real-world problem  
- To design a **grammar checking program**  
- To use **file handling** for storing user data  
- To implement a **menu-driven system** with login and signup functionality  

---

## 🧠 Data Structures Used
- **Queue** – To process and analyze the input sentence  
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** – To store and validate user login credentials  
- **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)** – To define grammatical rules  
- **File Handling** – To store parts of speech and user information

## 🗂️ Modules Description

### 1️⃣ Context Free Grammar
- Contains definitions of parts of speech  
- Defines valid grammatical sentence structures  

### 2️⃣ Queue
- Takes sentence input from the user  
- Processes words sequentially for grammar checking  

### 3️⃣ BST (Binary Search Tree)
- Stores user information (email & password)  
- Handles **Signup** and **Login** authentication  
- Data is stored in a file named `student_info`

### 4️⃣ Menu Driven System
- Displays menu options:
  - Signup
  - Login
  - Exit
- Calls relevant modules based on user choice  

### 5️⃣ Main Module
- Integrates all modules  
- Controls the overall execution of the program
